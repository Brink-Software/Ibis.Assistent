# üó®Ô∏èAzure OpenAI Console Application

This console application provides an interface to work with Azure OpenAI. Leveraging Azure Blob Storage, it stores various documents pertinent to Ibis Helpdesk questions. Azure Search Service then indexes these blob files, and Azure OpenAI is used to train on this data, facilitating optimized responses based on the Ibis Helpdesk dataset.
